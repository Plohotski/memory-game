# Memory-game

### Memory-game "European Union" is a multi-level educational game consisting of a set of pairs of identical cards with the flags of the countries of the European Union, which are displayed face down. By clicking on a card, the player turns it over and clicks on the next card. If two cards show the same flags, they remain open, and the name of the country is displayed; if the flags are different, the cards are turned face down. The goal of the game is to open all countries in the least number of moves.
